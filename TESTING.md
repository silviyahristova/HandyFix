## Accessibility

### Color contrast

* The main colors, used for the website, have very good contrast. They were tested with [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools

* On all pages same alert came up - that there is more than 1 redundant link. This is, because some links are navigating users to the same page, but was made to be user friendly and intuitive as possible for the user. No further action was taken.
