This helps users understand if the handyman can address their specific needs. The website.

By making the site fully responsive, the site aims to be easily accessible no matter which platform the user is viewing the site on.

### **Scope**

The main features that will be implemented into the website will be included on four separate pages. The design of the website should look professional and trustworthy at the same time simple and eye-catching. In help to create this design will be carefully selected color palette and fonts.

The site will have an "About section" where users can learn some more information about the company. This will help build more trust in users. We will provide contact details, making it easy for users to get in touch. We will showcase previous work through photos, testimonials, and a video. This will help users gauge the handyman`s skill and quality of work. Users can find out if the handymen serves their geographical area, ensuring that they are accessible to potential customers. The website will show pricing information. This transparency can help users budget for their home improvement projects.

### **Structure**

The structure of the website is to have four separate pages. It is designed to be mobile-first design. Every page will have a header and footer.

The home page will be made of five sections, providing essential information. The sections on the page will be Header, Why choose our company for your home repair?, Our services, Testimonials, and Footer. The header will consist of the company logo and a navigation section which will be a list with a hamburger icon for smaller devices and then be a text on the desktop. In the "Why choose our company for your home repair?" section will be included relevant information about the company, photos of the handyman team, and icons that will show the main reasons to choose the company. In the "Our services" section will be named services, provided by the handymen, with icons that will make it easy to identify the service. The icons will be clickable and will send users to the Service page. The testimonial section will provide reviews from customers, who already used the services. This will help potential customers more easily decide to get in touch with the company. The footer will include the company logo, contact information with icons for easy identification of the information, quick links to the pages on the website, and social media links, so users can follow company pages on the provided platforms.

The service page will be made up of five sections- header with logo and navigation bar; services section where will be added photo to relevant service with specific information about what the service includes, price section with information about the prices; gallery section where users can see previous work done by handymen; and footer section with contact information and quick links.

The contact page will be made up of three sections.

The success page will be made of three sections. There will be a header section with a navigation bar and logo, section with a message that will show users that they successfully complete the form, and footer with contact information and quick links.

### **Skeleton**

To create the wireframes, the design tool Figma is used. There were nine frames created- for the tree main pages and for three devices- desktop, tablet, and mobile. They were created to help establish a clear and organized structure for the website. They provide an outline of the layout how elements will be arranged on the screen, and how the interface will adopt the different screen sizes and devices, laying the foundation for responsive design.
