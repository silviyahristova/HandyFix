### **Skeleton**

To create the wireframes, the design tool Figma is used. There were nine frames created- for the tree main pages and for three devices- desktop, tablet, and mobile. They were created to help establish a clear and organized structure for the website. They provide an outline of the layout how elements will be arranged on the screen, and how the interface will adopt the different screen sizes and devices, laying the foundation for responsive design.

**Typography**

The fonts that will be used in the website will be imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and will be used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato). Roboto has clean and simple design which pairs well with Lato`s versatility and legibility. Together they are creating a sleek and minimalist look that is ideal for modern website. Both are sans-serif fonts that share similar characteristics in terms of letterforms and proportions in their modern desing.

Roboto will be used for the logo and headings in each section, while Lato will be used for the main body text.

**Logo**

The logo is created by myself using Figma design tool. The font for the brand is Roboto, for the slogan is Lato. The colors are choosen from the palette for the website. This will help users connect the logo with the colors of the company and website.
